1. Calculate the effective bound M(n)
for which the following is true:

If \phi is true in a
structure of rank > M(n),
it is true for infinitely many ranks.

2. Prove that if satisfiable in
order of rank omega,
it is satisfiable in order of 
every infinite rank.

3. Prove/disprove
the same thing, but for maximal left-right sets.

4. Fix the definition such that $\omega^\omega$ is NOT
an annoying edge case.
Probably should be closed under finite sums.



# Solution
The definition is:
For a finite $\zeta$ the rank is $0$.
a finite sum of $\omega$ and $-\omega$ of rank $< \alpha$ has rank $\le \alpha$.


1. \phi satisfiable in C+[alpha]_{R/L/R+L} decidable.
2. The same, but in finite sums of the above.
3. The same, but omega sum of the above.

4. Claim:
Let L be an order.
Then L = \sum L_i where
rk+ L_i <= \alpha + 1
and there exist no non-maximal L_i, L_i+1
such that L_i is non-maximal on the right, and
L_i+1 is non-maximal on the left.
