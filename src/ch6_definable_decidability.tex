\section{Decidability of Definable Intervals}

\begin{definition}
    Let $\dfn$ be the class of all linear orders defined
    by an $\mso$-formula
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}
    Let $\varphi$ be an $\mso$-sentence. The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\varphi$ has at least $2^{\aleph_0}$ models.
        \item $\varphi$ has uncountably many models.
        \item $\varphi$ has an undefinable model.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    ($1 \implies 2$) Trivial.
    ($2 \implies 3$) Since there are only countably many
    definable linear orders, if $\varphi$ has uncountably many models,
    then there is an undefinable model.
    
    ($3 \implies 1$) TBC.
\end{proof}
