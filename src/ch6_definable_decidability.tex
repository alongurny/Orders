\section{Decidability of Definable Intervals}

\begin{definition}
    Let $\dfn$ be the class of all linear orders defined
    by an $\mso$-formula
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal.

    Let $\varphi$ be an $\mso$-formula.
    We say that $\varphi$ is \emph{$\le \kappa$-ambiguous}
    if it has at most $\kappa$ many models.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal.

    Let $M$ be a linear order.
    We say that $M$ is \emph{$\le \kappa$-ambiguous}
    if it is a model of some $\le \kappa$-ambiguous $\mso$-formula.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $I$ be $\omega$ labeled over $P_1, \ldots, P_k$, and suppose $I$ is $\le \kappa$-ambiguous for some cardinal $\kappa$.
    Let $F$ be a function assigning each truth vector in $2^k$ a definable linear order.

    Then $M = \sum_{i \in I} F(P_1(i), \ldots, P_k(i))$ is $\le \kappa$-ambiguous.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    It is immediate.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $M_1$ be a $\le \kappa_1$-ambiguous linear order for some cardinal $\kappa_1$,
    and let $M_2$ be a $\le \kappa_2$-ambiguous linear order for some cardinal $\kappa_2$.

    Then $M_1 + M_2$ is $\le \kappa_1 \kappa_2$-ambiguous.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    It is immediate.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Then $\varphi$ be an $\le \aleph_0$-ambiguous $\mso$-formula.
    Then every scattered model
    of $\varphi$ is in $\ho{< \omega}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $n = \qd {\varphi}$.

    Let $M$ be a scattered model of $\varphi$.

    If $M \in \ho{\ge \omega}$,
    then for every ordinal $\omega \le \alpha < \omega_1$,
    there is some $N \in \ho{= \alpha}$
    such that $N \equiv_n M$.

    This means that $\varphi$ has at least one model
    of every rank between $\omega$ and $\omega_1$,
    which in particular means uncountably many models.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
    Let $\varphi$ be an $\mso$-formula.

    Then $\varphi$ is $\le \aleph_0$-ambiguous
    iff it has only definable models.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    ($\impliedby$) Since there are only countably many definable models,
    if $\varphi$ has only definable models,
    then it has at most countably many models.

    ($\implies$) Suppose $\varphi$ is $\le \aleph_0$-ambiguous.
    By the previous lemma, every scattered model has
    finite rank, so we will prove first, by $\omega$-induction
    on the rank, that every scattered model of $\varphi$ is definable.

    Let $M$ be a scattered model of $\varphi$. If $\hrank{M} = 0$,
    then $M = 1$, so it is in particular definable.

    Otherwise, let $\hrank{M} = \alpha$, and let
    $I = M / \sim_\alpha$, and $\set{M_i}_{i \in I}$
    be the equivalence classes of $M$ under $\sim_\alpha$.

    Also, $\hrank{I} = \alpha - 1$.

    By the composition theorem, there is a formula
    $\psi(\vec{Y})$ such that $M \models \varphi$ iff $I \models \psi(\vec{Q})$,
    where $Q_\tau = \set{ i \in I : M_i \models \tau }$ for 
    every $n$-type $\tau$.

\end{proof}
